						<h2>Events</h2>
						<p>What makes us Italy</p>
					</header>

					<img class="image fit" src="images/rome/r241.jpg" alt="" />
					<p>Throughout Italy there is a large range of events held throughout the year. Below you can find a few of the main events held annually in various parts of Italy.</p>
					 <br>
						<div class="content">
							<h2>Venice - The Venice Film Festival</h2>
							<p>Venice Film Festival is an annual event which takes place at the end of August / beginning of September. It's one of the events organised by the Venice Biennale organisation, and is an important public relations event for the city. Although there are art-house films and prizes, each year there is a Hollywood element which attracts the paparazzi and gives the city a bit of glitz.</p>

							<h2>Rome - Teatro dell'Opera</h2>
							<p>Also known as the Teatro Costanzi, Rome's leading theatre is an attractive opera house, which puts on extravagant opera productions, interspersed with ballets. The Teatro dell'Opera has its own orchestra and ballet company, both of a high standard.</p>

							<h2>Venice - Venice Carnival</h2>
							<p>Venice's Carnival takes place in February, in the days leading up to Shrove Tuesday. It used to last ten days but now in order to extend this high-earning tourist season, events often start the weekend before that. Consequently the main events of the 2015 Carnival take place 7th - 17th February, but the first celebrations start on the weekend of the 30th/31st January.
<br>
Carnival, or Carnevale, has been celebrated for centuries throughout Italy. The name is said to derive from the words carne vale - 'farewell to meat' - which explain the function of the celebration: an opportunity to indulge and use up such treats before the start of Lent (like an extended Pancake Day).

							<h2>Verona - Opera at the Arena</h2>
							<p>Seeing the opera in Verona is one of Italy's great travel experiences. Every summer the city's Roman Arena is taken over by grandiose opera productions on an epic scale. Many music-loving travellers visit Verona just to attend the opera; the town's charms are an attractive extra. If you are staying in or around Verona during the summer, it is well worth planning an evening at the opera to appreciate the music, the spectacle, and the experience of spectating at an event in this ancient Roman venue.</p>
