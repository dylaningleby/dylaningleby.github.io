						<h2>About Me</h2>
					</header>

					<a class="image fit"><img src="images/img3.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<h1 style="font-size:20px;">A teenage boy wanting to be a member of a professional sports team. The dream shared by many, but whilst I may not play for any team, I am aiming to still be involved in it all.</h1>
					<p>Growing up in Cairns my sporting options were limited, but I still loved supporting the town’s only national sports team, the Cairns Taipans. Though as I grew up, I realised that I performed much better off the court than on, often being at the top of the grade in many academic subjects. As I entered high school at St Mary’s Catholic College, Cairns, I began to channel my abilities, and often found myself outperforming my peers on digital design tasks. This lead to my teacher giving me the job of building the school in the 3D modelling program Sketchup whilst the class caught up, a task which I enjoyed.</p>
					<p>As I continued through high school I quickly became proficient in the use of many pieces of software, including the majority of the Adobe Creative Suite (particularly Photoshop, Dreamweaver and Flash), Blender, Sketchup and some Autodesk programs such as Inventor and Revit. Using my knowledge of these programs I have completed a wide range of assignments in many subjects such as Graphics, ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) and ITS (Information Technology Systems), including building multiple websites, designing houses and building a 3D model of an airport.</p>
					<p>In Grade 10, I quickly started taking up multiple leadership roles, and rapidly became the go-to-guy for many of the school’s events. After I won the Spirit of St Mary’s Senior Medallion for my hard working and charitable character as well as my contribution to the school, one of the main teachers I assisted approached me and complimented me on how trustworthy and reliable I was.</p>
					<p>During Grade 11 I decided to try and find a career I enjoyed, so I took up the position of Social Media Manager for the online video game My Racing Career, a role which I filled for ten months before I resigned to focus on graduating. Through my time in this role I managed the Tumblr page for the video game, which included writing articles about the latest additions to the game, designing digital content, and publishing all of this to the Tumblr blog.</p>
					<p>As I finished high school I decided to volunteer at the Cairns Taipans as an Usher, which required me to be punctual and arrive at the game prior to the doors opening, before I then showed guests to their assigned seats. At the end of the season I had a conversation with my supervisor at the Taipans, during which he stated that he would be more than happy to have me return to the Taipans in an expanded role during the NBL 18/19 season.</p>
					<p>Shortly after I started studying a Bachelor of Media and Communication at QUT, I decided to ask sports teams if I could possibly assist with the running of their social media pages, which has led to my current position at the QUT Wildcats, who compete in multiple basketball competitions around Brisbane. This position requires me to attend games and take photos, before using my expertise in Adobe Photoshop to edit them so they are ready to upload.</p>
